# Pacman

- This game is `Google's Pacman` which I have built in `pygame`.
- Dependencies: `python` and `pygame`.
- All the assets are provided `./assets` directory.
- I have provided the pacman world in the `./assets/data/pacman_world.json`, or you can create your own

## Usage

make sure you have installed the `python` and the `pygame` library.

- clone this repo

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/karanBRAVO/Pacman.git
  ```

- change the directory

  ```bash
  cd Pacman
  ```

- run the script

  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

the script will ask you to load the layout or to create a new layout enter yes or no then game will be launched if you enter no

- `caution:` sounds will be played automatically
